"""
make_worksheets.py — human-eval worksheet per paper for the _robustness runs.

Uses the project's MERGED-BY-DEFECT (soft) matcher, not the strict anchor one:
the 10 runs' raw findings are grouped into distinct defects (the same adversarial
re-clustering behind _robustness/data/merged_clusters.json and the D-numbered
census worksheet of the original human-eval apparatus, since removed). Because the new PDF+text runs produced their
own findings, the clusters below were re-derived for THESE runs; fids are
`r{run}#{idx}` into _robustness/<paper>/run_NN/findings.json.

Unlike the blinded census worksheet, this one SHOWS severity + confidence +
detection rate (the reviewer asked for them) and uses a 4-way verdict box.

Run:  python _robustness/make_worksheets.py
Writes: _robustness/HUMAN_EVAL_<pid>.md   (one per paper)
