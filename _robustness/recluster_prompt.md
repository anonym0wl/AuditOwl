# Merge-by-defect re-clustering prompt (`recluster-robustness`)

The adversarial LLM pass that produced the merged-by-defect clustering in
`data/merged_clusters.json`, the matcher behind every "merged" reliability
number (detection rate, Jaccard, Krippendorff α, Gwet AC1).

The workflow ran **one agent per paper** (`PAPERS = ['1829','1333','2657','2578','2371']`)
in parallel, each forced to return structured output against the schema below.
Input per paper: a JSON object
`{paper, n_runs, findings:[{fid, run, category, loc, title, claim}]}` assembled from
each run's `findings.json`. `fid` strings are `r{run}#{idx}` indices into
each run's `findings.json`.

## Agent prompt (verbatim)

```
You are de-duplicating reproducibility-audit findings produced by 10 independent repeat audits of the SAME paper and SAME frozen codebase. Each run surfaced several findings; the same real defect is often described at a different file/line, under a different category, or in different words across runs. Your job: group findings that describe the SAME underlying defect into one cluster, so we can measure how reliably each TRUE defect is re-detected.

Read the file /tmp/recluster/${num}.json, it has {paper, n_runs, findings:[{fid, run, category, loc, title, claim}]}.

CLUSTERING RULE (be precise and conservative):
- Put two findings in the SAME cluster IFF they are about the SAME underlying defect, the same thing wrong with the same artifact/behaviour, EVEN IF they differ in:
    • category (one run files it 'missing', another 'methodology'/'bug'/'difference'),
    • location (one cites paper.pdf, another cites run.py; or different line ranges of the same mechanism),
    • wording / which specific file or table they name as the example.
  Example of SAME defect: "benchmark datasets + Q-matrices not in repo" cited at README.md, at a .sh script, and at model/OLinear_C.py are ONE defect (the data/Q-matrices aren't shipped). "best-on-test selection" cited in run.py and in exp_forecast.py is ONE defect.
- Keep findings in DIFFERENT clusters if they are genuinely distinct defects, even if same category or same file (e.g. "requirements unpinned" vs "wrong PyPI name 'pywt'" are arguably distinct, use judgment; if one clearly subsumes/duplicates the other across runs, merge; if they're independent problems, don't).
- Do NOT merge just because two findings share a topic or category. Merge only genuine same-defect duplicates.
- EVERY fid must be assigned to exactly one cluster. Singleton clusters (a defect only one run raised) are expected and correct, do not force-merge them.

Return: paper, n_findings_assigned (= total fids you placed; must equal the input findings count), and clusters (each = {label, fids:[exact fid strings]}). Use the exact fid strings from the file. Add a one-line notes on how aggressively you merged.
```

(`${num}` is substituted per paper.)

## Output schema (forced structured output)

```json
{
  "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["paper", "n_findings_assigned", "clusters", "notes"],
  "properties": {
    "paper": { "type": "string" },
    "n_findings_assigned": { "type": "integer",
      "description": "total fids placed into clusters (must equal the input count)" },
    "clusters": { "type": "array", "items": {
      "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false,
      "required": ["label", "fids"],
      "properties": {
        "label": { "type": "string", "description": "short description of the single underlying defect" },
        "fids":  { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" },
                   "description": "exact fid strings from the input file" }
      }
    }},
    "notes": { "type": "string" }
  }
}
```

The `n_findings_assigned == input count` requirement + downstream coverage check
in `make_worksheets.py` (every raw fid in exactly one cluster) is the
"complete + exact partition" validation referenced in `recluster_comparison.json`.

## Adversarial verification of the partition

Paper 2578's 16-defect partition was independently re-checked by a second
workflow, `verify-2578-clustering`: three
adversarial reviewers under a merge-lens, split-lens, and assignment-lens, each
returning structured `should_merge / should_split / misassigned_fid / wrong_label`
issues.

## Note on the "upper bound" wording

`recluster_comparison.json` labels merged the "upper bound on reliability." The
prompt is explicitly **conservative** (merge only genuine duplicates; never
force-merge singletons; keep distinct defects separate), so it under-merges by
design relative to a coarse by-problem grouping. It is the *more lenient of the
two computed matchers* (vs. the strict anchor matcher), but relative to true
defect-level grouping it is a **conservative** estimate, not a ceiling (see the
Metrics section of `_robustness/README.md`).
