"""Print the headline reproducibility funnel.

Reads the auditable per-paper coverage data
(_summary/data/coverage_status.json, produced by build_coverage_figure.py) and
derives every count here, so the funnel stays in sync with the audit set.

A paper's "traced artifacts" are the result-artifacts (tables, columns, metrics,
ablations) the auditor chose to check. A row counts as having "producing code"
when it was NOT flagged missing — i.e. some code that produces it was located.
